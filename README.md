# Etch-a-Sketch
An Etch-a-Sketch app as part of The Odin Project. 

## Tech Stack
The project utilises HTML, CSS and JavaScript for the user interface. 

## Under The Hood
The grid container is pre-defined and the grid squares are generated with JavaScript upon each brush selection. 
The requirements were to allow the user to specify the size of the grid, but I thought it would be interesting to allow the user to rather specify the brush size interactively. More brushes can be added programmatically. 
For further expansion the user can be allowed to create custom brush sizes (maybe with a slider). 
I don't really like the multi-colored squares, and would rather settle for single-colored squares. For demo purposes I kept it multi-colored.
